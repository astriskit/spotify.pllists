# About

A ReactJS web app that helps users to store their Spotify playlists locally. The web app fetches new featured playlists from the Spotify api and users can then locally save the playlists that they like.

# Objectives:

1. Use react and redux.
2. Use the spotify api to get featured-playlists.
3. Allow to save the playlists locally by drag'n'drop functionality.
4. Use, optionally, any ui library like material-ui, etc.

# User flows:
- Hop on to the landing page to get top featured playlists from spotify and locally-stored playlists, if any.
- To save a playlist-item locally, drag the item from left-list to the right list-area (initially, when no saved items, to the box which says smthing like "drag here..".
- Items can exist in any one of the lists, i.e., either right or left.
- To open the playlist on spotify - click on the small playlist-cover (image) in any of the lists.
- To remove the currently stored items - one by one - click on `x` button; It removes the item from right-side and add to left-side.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
